  yaim - yet another ip manager

  yaim will check the healthiness of a component (e.g. via http GET, PostgreSQL query, shell).
  If the node is healthy, this information is published in a DCS (distributed consensus store)
  and all yaim registered in the same service directory will race to take on virtual IP addresses.
  All IP addresses specified in the DCS will always be connected to one of the nodes,
  so this concept can be easily used together with round robin DNS load balancing.
  If the health check fails or the node goes down, the remaining nodes will shortly afterwards
  try to take over the unused IP addresses.

  yaim can be used as a replacement for keepalived or other virtual IP management solutions.
  It can provide high availability and redundancy on a network level and as such doesn't require
  any special client or server modifications.
