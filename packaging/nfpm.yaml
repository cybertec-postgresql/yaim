  yaim - yet another ip manager
   yaim will check the healthiness of a specific postgresql
   or pgbouncer server. If the node is healthy, this information
   is published in etcd and all yaim registered in the same
   service directory will race to take on virtual IP addresses.
   All IP addresses specified in etcd will always lead to one of
   the nodes, so this concept can be easily used together with
   round robin DNS load balancing.
